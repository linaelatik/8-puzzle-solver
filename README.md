# 8-puzzle-solver

## Description
This project implements the n-puzzle problem (e.g., 8-puzzle) using A* search. It supports multiple heuristics for solving the puzzle efficiently.

## Features
- **Heuristics**:
  - Number of misplaced tiles (`h1`)
  - Manhattan distance (`h2`)
  - Manhattan distance with linear conflicts (`h3`)
- **Solves puzzles of any size** (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
- Validates if a puzzle is solvable.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-puzzle-solver.git
